# Welcome to the CRCD GitHub

The Center for Research Computing and Data (CRCD) is a high performance computing center working to support scientific research, education, and outreach at the University of Pittsburgh.
As part of this mission, we recognize the value of open-source software and encourage code sharing and collaboration across the research community.
This GitHub organization provides access to all open-source software developed by the CRC for both internal and public use.

## How to contribute

The CRCD's primary mission is to support research at the University of Pittsburgh.
However, we strive to design high quality software in a way that is useful to the broader HPC community.
If you have an idea for a project or would like to contribute to an existing project, please feel free to create a pull request or issue on the relevant repository.
