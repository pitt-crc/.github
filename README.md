# Welcome to the CRC GitHub

The Center for Research Computing (CRC) is a high performance computing center designed to support scientific research, education, and outreach at the University if Pittsburgh.
As part of this mission, we recognize the value of open-source software and encourage code sharing and collaboration across the research community.

## How to contribute

The CRC's primary mission is to support research at the University of Pittsburgh.
However, we strive to design high quality software in a way that is useful to the broader HPC community.
